What is Web3.js?

This is the Ethereum compatible JavaScript API which implements the Generic JSON RPC spec. It's available on npm as a node module, for Bower and component as embeddable scripts, and as a meteor.js package.


Here's an example of what the object looks like:

```js
var Web3 = require('web3');

> Web3.utils
> Web3.version
> Web3.givenProvider
> Web3.providers
> Web3.modules
```


## The challenge:

Create a file named `web3.js`.

In that file import the Web3 package and `console.log()` it out.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

`learnweb3 verify web3.js`
